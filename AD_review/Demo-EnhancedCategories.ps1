.SYNOPSIS
    Demo script showing enhanced categorization with MITRE ATT&CK mapping

.DESCRIPTION
    This script demonstrates what your findings would look like with:
    1. Security vs Health categorization
    2. MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
    3. Enhanced risk scoring
    4. Category-based prioritization
