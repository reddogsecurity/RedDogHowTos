## üìã Project Overview

A comprehensive PowerShell-based security assessment tool for Active Directory and Entra ID (Azure AD) environments. Performs read-only data collection and automated security analysis to identify risks, suggest RBAC roles, and plan modernization efforts.

> **üéØ Perfect for:** Security audits, Zero Trust assessments, RBAC planning, GPO modernization, and compliance reporting.

## üíª Usage

### Basic AD-Only Assessment
```powershell
.\script.ps1
```

### Full AD + Entra Assessment
```powershell
.\script.ps1 -IncludeEntra
```

### Custom Output Location
```powershell
.\script.ps1 -IncludeEntra -OutputFolder "C:\Assessments\Client1"
```

### Review Results
1. Open the generated HTML summary: `summary-{timestamp}.html`
2. Review CSV artifacts for detailed analysis
3. Address High severity findings immediately
4. Plan remediation using the risk findings CSV

## üêõ Known Issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Encoding Issues**: Avoid emojis and special characters in Write-Host strings (causes parsing errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Graph Module Limit**: Do not import full `Microsoft.Graph` module (exceeds PowerShell function limit)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Large Environments**: MFA collection limited to first 500 users (performance)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Permissions**: Some Entra features require admin consent on first run

## üë• Contributing

### Adding New Risk Rules
Edit the `Analyze-Inventory` function (lines ~360-481):
```powershell
# Add your custom rule
if ($yourCondition) {
    $findings.Add([pscustomobject]@{
        Area='Your Area'; 
        Finding='Your finding description'; 
        Severity='High|Medium|Low'; 
        Evidence='source-file-reference'
    })
}
```

### Adding New Data Collection
1. Add collection code in `Collect-ADInventory` or `Collect-EntraInventory`
2. Export using `Write-OutputFiles -Name "entity-name" -Object $data`
3. Update `Analyze-Inventory` to load and analyze the new data
